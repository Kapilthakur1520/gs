            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Civil Engineering with a focus on Geospatial Engineering at IIT Roorkee. My research explores "3D Reconstruction Using Deep Learning Techniques and Novel View Synthesis," where I work on integrating data from LiDAR, photogrammetry, drone imagery, and 360-degree videos to create 3D models.
                I completed my B.Tech in Civil Engineering at NIT Hamirpur and gained hands-on field experience as a Civil Engineer at SJVN, contributing to major infrastructure projects. Along the way, I’ve developed skills in GIS tools like QGIS and ArcGIS, drone data processing, LiDAR, photogrammetry, and programming in Python and MATLAB, with a growing interest in applying machine learning and deep learning techniques to geospatial challenges.
